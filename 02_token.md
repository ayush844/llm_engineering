# TOKENS

## 1️⃣ What’s a **token** in GPT?

A **token** is a chunk of text that GPT uses as a basic unit of understanding.
It’s **not** always a full word — it can be:

* A whole word (`apple`)
* Part of a word (`un`, `break`, `able`)
* Punctuation (`?`, `.`)
* Spaces (` `)

In GPT’s world, tokens are just **numbers** (IDs) that map to text pieces using a vocabulary.

---

## 2️⃣ What is **tokenization**?

**Tokenization** is the process of splitting text into these tokens before the model processes it.

For example, GPT might split:

```
"I love pizza!"
```

Into tokens like:

```
["I", " love", " pizza", "!"]
```

(each space before a word is part of the token).

---

## 3️⃣ Why tokens matter

* **Model input/output limit** → GPT doesn’t work with unlimited text; it has a *context window* (e.g., GPT-4o has \~128k tokens, GPT-5 possibly more).
* **Billing** → API usage is often charged per token (input + output tokens).
* **Efficiency** → Working at the token level is faster and more memory-efficient than per-character.

## 4️⃣ Real example with GPT tokenization

Using OpenAI’s tokenizer (`tiktoken` library in Python):

```python
import tiktoken

enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
tokens = enc.encode("I love pizza!")
print(tokens)          # → [40, 477, 1234, 0]
print(len(tokens))     # → 4 tokens
```

Here:

* Each number is a token ID in GPT’s vocabulary.
* `4 tokens` total.

---

## 5️⃣ Tokens vs Words — Rough Estimate

On average:

* **1 token ≈ 4 characters of English**
* **1 token ≈ ¾ of a word**
* Example: 100 tokens ≈ 75 words

But this varies a lot depending on the language and complexity.

---

## 6️⃣ Analogy

Think of **tokenization** like breaking a song into beats:

* GPT doesn’t “hear” the whole song at once — it hears beat by beat.
* Each **beat** = token.
* Tokenization = splitting the song into beats before playing it to GPT.

## 🔹 How token billing works

When OpenAI (or any GPT-based API) talks about “X dollars per million tokens,” it includes:

1. **Input tokens** → all the tokens in your prompt + system prompt + any conversation history you send.
2. **Output tokens** → all the tokens in the model’s reply.

You’re billed for the **total**:

```
Total cost = (input tokens + output tokens) × price per token
```

---

## 🔹 Example

Let’s say:

* Prompt: `"Explain quantum physics simply."` → **6 tokens**
* Output: `"Quantum physics studies very tiny particles..."` → **20 tokens**
* Total: **26 tokens**

If the price is `$5 per 1M tokens`:

```
Cost = (26 ÷ 1,000,000) × $5 ≈ $0.00013
```

---

## 🔹 Key Point

Everything that goes **into** the model and everything that **comes out** is tokenized.
The “\$ for X million tokens” pricing **always** counts both directions.
